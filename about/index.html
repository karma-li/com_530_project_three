      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p id="about_1">
        My name is Karma. I am originally from China, and I have been living in California for
        years. Now I am a first year graduate student in IIT, majoring in Technical Communications
        and Information Architecture.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Am I Here?</h2>
      <p id="about_2">
        How does one tell a story that attracts people? To answer this question, the first point
        popped up in my head is “to make it interesting”. And speaking of interesting, there is a
        field named entertainment devoting to holding the attention and interest of the audience.
        Although people’s attention is drawn by different things due to individuals’ different
        preferences in entertainment, most of the entertainment productions are approaches to
        communicate with the audience and bring them pleasure and delight. This makes me full of
        enthusiasm and drives me to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.
      </p>
      <p id="about_3">
        In college, I was a broadcaster for the school’s radio and focused my interviews not just on
        luminaries, but on students. I also joined a start-up advertising firm and worked on
        branding and identity for small scale fashion and beauty brands that sold through WeChat. In
        2017, I worked in post-production at a Beijing entertainment company. Although the
        experience gave me a deeper understanding of media in the Chinese market, I believe that to
        understand how to create and sell the entertainment productions that speak to an
        international audience, I need to pursue a communications degree in the US.
